--------------

If the builds of the game donâ€™t work, you can try:

- First, have at least `python 3.11`, and `pygame-ce 2.2.1`.

- Then, go to https://github.com/Yu266426/pygbase/tree/Easter-Jam-2023, and download it as a zip.

- Unzip the folder, and in the terminal (cd into the folder with all the stuff in it) run `pip install .`

- Now, you have everything installed to run the `main.py` file.
