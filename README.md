# Egg Hunt!

Collect eggs to try and survive as long as possible on a disintegrating island!
--------------

Unfortunately, I can only build for MacOS (ARM, idk if that makes a difference), and so windows users will have a little harder of a time installing things:

- First, have at least `python 3.11`, and `pygame-ce 2.2.1`.

- Then, go to https://github.com/Yu266426/pygbase, and download it as a zip.

- Unzip the folder, and in the terminal (cd into the folder with all the stuff in it) run `pip install .`

- Now, you have everything installed to run the `main.py` file.
